            <h4><b><i>THE AYODHYA</i></b></h4>
            Translating to Ram's Birthplace, the Ram Janmabhoomi is believed to have
            been the birthplace of the Hindu deity, Lord Ram. According to the Indian epic
            Ramayan, Ram, Lord Vishnu's seventh manifestation, is said to have grown up along
            Ayodhya's river Sarayu. The Ram Janmabhoomi is a highly revered site for Hindu devotees.
            After being a conflicted site for decades, the Ram Janmabhoomi land was handed over to
            a trust by the Supreme Court of India to build the Ram Temple.

         <div>   <h4><b><i>THE  SHIRDI</i></b></h4>
            Believed to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva, Sai Baba is the only reason
                 why spiritual travellers come Shirdi town in Maharashtra. Even though the origins of his
                birth and early years are unclear, his staying in Shirdi for 3 years and returning after
                a yearâ€™s disappearance in 1858 marks an important period and year. He died in 1918 after
                years of spreading teachings that had elements of Hinduism and Islam. He is said to have
                taken Samadhi (meditative consciousness).</div>
        <div><h4><b><i>THE HARIDWAR</i></b></h4>
        The city is situated on the right bank of the Ganges river, at the foothills
        of the Shivalik ranges.[5] Haridwar is regarded as a holy place for Hindus,
        hosting important religious events and serving as a gateway to several prominent
        places of worship. Most significant of the events is the Kumbha Mela, which is
        celebrated every 12 years in Haridwar. During the Haridwar Kumbh Mela, millions of
         pilgrims, devotees, and tourists congregate in Haridwar to perform ritualistic bathing
        on the ganga......</div>
        <div><h4><b><i>The Rishikesh</i></b></h4>
            Rishikesh is also known for its connection with The Beatles. In February 1968,
            members of the legendary English rock band visited Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram
            (now popularly known as the Beatles Ashram) to learn transcendental meditation. 
            The band composed nearly 48 songs during their time at the Maharishi's ashram,
            many of which appear on the White Album (and a few from Abbey Road). John Lennon 
            recorded a song titled, 'The Happy Rishikesh Song' after his visit. </div>
            <div><h4><b><i>The Dehradun</i></b></h4>
                The district is named after its chief city Dehra Dun.
                Dehra appears to be a collection of deras signifying a temporary abode
                or camp. During the reign of Aurangzeb, Ram Rai, Guru of the Udasi Sikhs
                on being ordered by the Mughal king to retire to the wilderness of the Dun,
                had pitched his tents here in what is now the Khurbura locality of the town 
                and has also built a temple near Dhamawala. Around these two sites, grew up the
